# Diversity in Tech Project Portfolio

This Shiny application provides an interactive analysis of diversity within major tech companies from 2014 to 2018. The dataset explores the representation of different ethnic groups, including White, Asian, Latino, and Black employees, as well as gender diversity. I created customizations that allows users to filter data by year and visualizes the percentage of each ethnic group within selected companies.

**Features:**
* Interactive Year Selection: Use the slider to choose a range of years between 2014 and 2018 to filter the data.
* Ethnicity Representation Bar Chart: A bar plot that visualizes the percentage breakdown of different ethnic groups within tech companies, with color coding for easy comparison.
* Data Filtering and Exploration: Brush over the bar chart to view detailed data for the selected companies and ethnic groups.
* Dynamic Data Table: View filtered data in tabular format, allowing for further exploration and analysis of diversity trends.
* The app uses R libraries such as tidyr, dplyr, and ggplot2 to clean, transform, and visualize the data.
